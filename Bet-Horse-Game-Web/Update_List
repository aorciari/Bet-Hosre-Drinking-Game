Backend First
1.Database Integration: Before adding any new features, set up a database. This will be essential for storing user data, horse stats, race results, and more.

2.Horse Stats and History: With the database set up, you can extend your data model to include horse stats and historical performance. This feature lays the groundwork for more complex game mechanics and user engagement.

3.User Profiles: Implement user registration and authentication. This allows users to have a persistent presence in the game, track their stats, and engage more deeply with the platform.

4.Economy System: Establish a virtual currency system. This will enable you to add betting and purchasing functionalities later on.

5.Multiplayer Support: Implement real-time race viewing and betting, allowing users to interact with live races.

6.API Integration: If you plan to include dynamic weather or other external data influences, set up API integration to fetch this data.

7.Machine Learning: If you're considering adding machine learning features to predict race outcomes or enhance the game's AI, this would be the time, as it relies on existing data structures and user interaction.

Then Frontend
1.Animations and Graphics: Enhance the user interface with engaging visuals. Simple animations can make the race more dynamic and appealing.

2.Dynamic Weather: Integrate visual cues for weather conditions on the frontend, adding depth to the races and a layer of strategy for users.

3.Live Commentary: Implementing a live commentary feature can make races more engaging and dynamic, especially if users are watching races in real-time.

4.Leaderboard: Introduce a leaderboard to foster competition among users, encouraging them to engage more with the platform.

General Approach
Test as You Go: After implementing each feature, thoroughly test it to ensure stability and correctness.
Iterative Development: Develop features in iterations, starting with a basic version and then refining and expanding upon it.
User Feedback: If possible, gather user feedback after releasing new features to guide further improvements and prioritization.
